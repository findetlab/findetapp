                    <h2>6. App Permissions</h2>
                    <p>To utilize FinDet's full potential and access its most powerful features, the App requests certain permissions. These permissions are <strong>essential for analyzing your past and future spending patterns effectively</strong>, though technically optional.</p>

                    <h3>6.1 SMS/RCS Permission (Essential for Auto-Tracking)</h3>
                    <p><strong>Why It's Essential:</strong> This is the core feature that makes FinDet powerful. It enables automatic expense tracking from your bank transaction messages.</p>

                        <li>Used to automatically detect and categorize transactions from bank, payment, and merchant SMS/RCS messages</li>
                        <li>Reads both traditional SMS and RCS (Rich Communication Services) messages</li>
                        <li>All messages are scanned and processed 100% locally on your device</li>
                        <li>No SMS or RCS content ever leaves your device</li>
                        <li>Only transaction-related patterns (amount, merchant, date) are extracted</li>
                        <li>Essential for analyzing your spending history and future patterns</li>
                        <li>You can revoke this permission anytime from device settings</li>
                        <li>Without this permission, you must manually enter all transactions</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>6.2 Microphone Permission (Essential for Voice Input)</h3>
                    <p><strong>Why It's Essential:</strong> Enables hands-free transaction entry for convenience and accessibility.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Used for voice transaction input feature</li>
                        <li><strong>Important:</strong> Voice-to-text processing uses android built-in Google's Speech Recognition service</li>
                        <li>Voice audio is sent to Google's servers for transcription</li>
                        <li>Requires internet connection to function</li>
                        <li>FinDet never stores or has access to raw voice audio</li>
                        <li>Only text transcription is received and parsed locally</li>
                        <li>Transaction data stays on your device</li>
                        <li>Subject to Google's Privacy Policy: https://policies.google.com/privacy</li>
                        <li>You must explicitly consent before using this feature</li>
                        <li>You can revoke this permission anytime from device settings</li>
                        <li>You can use manual text entry instead at any time</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>6.3 Camera Permission (Essential for Receipt Records)</h3>

                        <li>No images are transmitted to external servers</li>
                        <li>Essential for maintaining complete transaction records</li>
                        <li>Perfect for business expenses and tax documentation</li>
                        <li>You can revoke this permission anytime from device settings</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>6.4 Other System Permissions</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Internet & Network State:</strong> Required ONLY for voice transaction feature (Google Speech Recognition) and app updates. Core functionality works 100% offline.</li>
                        <li><strong>Wake Lock & Battery Optimization:</strong> Ensures SMS monitoring and widget updates work reliably in the background</li>
                        <li><strong>Boot Completed:</strong> Restarts SMS monitoring after device reboot for continuous tracking</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>6.5 Permission Summary</h3>
                    <p><strong>All permissions are technically optional</strong> - you can use the app without granting them. However, these permissions are <strong>essential to serve you better and utilize FinDet to its fullest potential</strong> for comprehensive financial analysis. Without these permissions, core features like automatic expense tracking and voice input will not be available.</p>
