                    <p><strong>Why It's Essential:</strong> This is THE core feature that makes Findet powerful. Your bank already sent you transaction details via SMS/RCS. Findet simply reads and organizes this information so you can analyze your spending patterns.</p>
                    
                    <div style="background-color: #FFF3E0; padding: 16px; border-radius: 8px; border-left: 4px solid #FF9800; margin: 16px 0;">
                        <p style="margin: 8px 0 0 0;"><strong>We read SMS data ONLY from financial institutions such as banks, credit card companies, and payment service providers. We do NOT access, collect, or store personal SMS messages.</strong></p>
                        <p style="margin: 8px 0 0 0;"><strong>ALL your data stays on your device. NOTHING is ever transmitted to any server.</strong></p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>What We Access:</strong> Both SMS and RCS (Rich Communication Services) messages</li>

                    <details>
                        <summary><strong>Where is my financial data stored?</strong></summary>
                        <p>All financial data (transactions, accounts, balances, budgets) is stored locally on your device in encrypted storage. It never leaves your device.</p>
                    </details>

                    <details>
                        <summary><strong>Is my data synced across devices?</strong></summary>
                        <p>No. Findet does not sync data across devices. All data stays on the device where you created it. This ensures maximum privacy.</p>
                    </details>

                    <details>
                        <summary><strong>Can Findet see my transactions?</strong></summary>
                        <p>No. The developer cannot see your transactions, SMS messages, or any financial data. Everything stays encrypted on your device.</p>
                    </details>
                    <h3>About Voice Transactions</h3>
                    <details>
                        <summary><strong>Is voice processing done on my device?</strong></summary>
                        <p>No. Voice-to-text uses Google's Speech Recognition service, which sends audio to Google's servers. However, the transcribed text is then parsed locally on your device, and transaction data stays local.</p>
                    </details>

                    <details>
                        <summary><strong>Can I use Findet without voice features?</strong></summary>
                        <p>Yes! Voice transactions are completely optional. You can always use manual text entry for transactions.</p>
                    </details>

                    <details>
                        <summary><strong>Does Findet record my conversations?</strong></summary>
                        <p>No. Recording only happens when you explicitly tap the microphone button. There is no background listening or continuous monitoring.</p>
                    </details>

                    <details>
                        <summary><strong>What does Google do with my voice data?</strong></summary>
                        <p>Google processes voice audio to provide transcription. Please refer to Google's Privacy Policy for details on their data handling practices. Findet does not control Google's processing.</p>
                    </details>

                    <details>
                        <summary><strong>Can voice transactions work offline?</strong></summary>
                        <p>No. Voice-to-text requires an internet connection to send audio to Google's servers. However, manual transaction entry works 100% offline.</p>
                    </details>

                    <h3>About Data Sharing and Third Parties</h3>
                    <details>
                        <summary><strong>Does Findet share my data with anyone?</strong></summary>
                        <p>Findet does NOT share, sell, or transmit your financial data to ANY third party. The only external service used is Google Speech Recognition (optional, for voice feature only), which receives voice audio but NOT your financial data.</p>
                    </details>

                    <details>
                        <summary><strong>What about analytics or advertising?</strong></summary>
                        <p>Findet has NO analytics, NO advertising networks, and NO tracking. We don't collect usage data or show ads.</p>
                    </details>

                    <details>
                        <summary><strong>Can I trust Findet with my privacy?</strong></summary>
                        <p>Yes. Findet is designed with privacy-first principles: All financial data stays on your device, no account creation required, no automatic data collection, no data sharing with third parties, complete transparency about optional features (voice, SMS), and you control all permissions and data.</p>
                    </details>

                    <h3>About Permissions and Control</h3>
                    <details>
                        <summary><strong>Can I revoke permissions after granting them?</strong></summary>
                        <p>Yes! SMS, microphone and camera permissions can be revoked anytime from Android Settings → Apps → Findet → Permissions. Revoking permissions does not send any data to us.</p>
                    </details>

                    <details>
                        <summary><strong>What happens to my data if I uninstall the app?</strong></summary>
                        <p>When you uninstall Findet, all local data is deleted from your device. Since we don't store data on servers, there's nothing to delete from cloud storage.</p>
                    </details>

                    <details>
                        <summary><strong>How do I delete all my data?</strong></summary>
                        <p>Go to Menu → Settings → Clear All Data, or simply uninstall the app. All data is stored locally, so this removes everything.</p>

                    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
                    <p>Findet's offline nature provides enhanced protection for users of all ages, as we collect no personal information from any user. However, we recommend that children under 17 use this app only under parental supervision, as it involves financial concepts and requires understanding of money management principles.</p>
